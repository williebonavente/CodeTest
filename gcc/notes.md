# Properties of Algorithm

There are several properties that algorithm generally share. They are useful to keep in mind when algorithms are described.
These properties are:

## Input

- An algorithm has input values from a specified set.

## Output

- From each set of input values an algorithm produces output values from a specified set. The output values are the solution to the problem

## Definiteness

- The steps of an algorithm must be defined precisely.

## Correctness

- An algorithm should produce the correct output values for each set of input values.

## Finiteness

- An algorithm should produce the correct output values for each set of input values.

## Effectiveness

- It must be possible to perform each step of an algorithm exactly and in a finite amount of time.
  
## Generality

- The procedure should be applicable for all problems of the desired from, not just for a particular set of input values.
